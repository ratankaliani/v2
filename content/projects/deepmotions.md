Every minute, 300 hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube with distinct emotions expressed during each clip. By evaluating group audio clips through speech analysis algorithms, we can better understand the process of human interaction and help people truly improve their ability to speak. DeepMotions is a platform that leverages a web application framework to analyze .wav and .mp3 files and return data about the audio file asynchronously back to the web application where it is processed and displayed directly to users.
