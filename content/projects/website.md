You've probably already noticed - but welcome to my website! This was an experiment into building a site with Gatsby and is currently v2.0 of my personal website. Hopefully you've learned a little more about me, and I highly recommend building your own website if you haven't already - it's a fantastic way to both learn about web frameworks and about yourself!
