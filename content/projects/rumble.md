Rumble is an earthquake detection application that is used to mitigate risks from the occurrence of natural disasters, with a specific focus on the state of California, due to its reputation as an earthquake hotbed. The application is inteded to serve in the background for less-frequent users, providing them with real-time push notifications leveraging the US Geographical Service REST API when there are earthquakes. For more intensive users, the application provides a map alongside a chart displaying the distance from nearby earthquakes as well as their magnitudes. All users have cached preferences and personalization with Firebase.This was my first true experience building an app for Android and I'm looking forward to building more!
