MicroGrid is a U.S. P2P energy sharing platform that creates a competitive energy market with dynamic pricing built on the EW-DOS infrastructure. In this system, government regulated energy monopolies and individual energy producers sell on the same market through the existing power grid. We deliver competitive prices to retail consumers by leveraging the existing non-competitive surplus renewable energy market. MicroGrid will integrate with EW Origin such that producers may sell energy attribute certificates (EAC) and/or EWT tokens. Self-sovereign decentralized identifiers (SSI) will enable simple supplier switching as users build their identities with transaction histories. MicroGrid can reduce the need by leveraging smart contract-based Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems.
