At first glance, the question seems straightforward. At least 2 pages, less than 1200 words - seems simple enough.

After all, there are over a million ways to explain what it means to be an engineer, from national organizations to dictionary definitions to how you explain it to your little cousins to that piece of paper we collectively call a degree that I'll have framed on the wall of my apartment in two years. But how do I explain it to myself?

Does creating a polynomial-time reduction for an instance of the Independent Set problem make me an engineer? Designing an app that tells me what to wear tomorrow? Solving piles of Leetcode problems? Explaining to my 8 year old cousins what Ethereum is?

It's all of them at once, but at the same time none of them fully encompass what it means to me. Every single time my thoughts flow back to this internal conversation, I always converge to the same inflection point - my first week at Berkeley.

I came into college as a na√Øve and bubbly introvert turned extrovert who was ready to take on every challenge the world threw at him and come back not only with equal confidence but belief that I could change the very world in front of me. Four years in a competitive high school pushed me to the brink and brought me back and after all of it I had the opportunity to travel from the endless monotony of the forests of Northern Virginia to the endless opportunity of the Bay Area. Berkeley was everything that I had ever imagined - new, quirky and driven. Better yet, it gave me a chance at a new start - an opportunity to not only redefine the way that I look at the world but myself. Every idea, every thought felt like something I could absorb, process and use to define this new version of myself and I wasn't about to let anyone stop me.

I vividly remember jostling to find a single seat in a lecture hall stuffed to the brim with more than 3000 diverse, intricately connected and yet separate people from all around not only the United States but the world. My first day of college was a whirlwind - from the most intense discussion I've ever had about trees with the economics major from the heart of Taipei to the lob I tossed up to win a pickup game at RSF to a random kid from Lincoln, Nebraska. It was overwhelming but I never felt more capable in my life - learning names, recognizing faces, exploring places - there was nothing that I couldn't do. But all in all, it was one thing - unsustainable.

From clubs to socializing to exploration, life as a university student felt like anything but school, but everything centered around that one concept. I'm privileged to be in a position to be able to consider aspects of my life outside of just school while being a student that many previous generations didn't have access to, but that freedom has also opened an innumerable number of paths and opportunities for me to pursue. The issue is, I can only pick 1, maybe 2 at most if I want to put my full focus into them. This makes the problem evolve into: how do I accurately value these opportunities?

The easy, but correct answer is meaning. I work best when the problems I'm solving generate value for my community and the world as a whole, giving me personal motivation to grow. But how do I continuously quantify that metric?

Only when I can answer that will I be able to answer:
   1) Why do I do what I do?
   2) What's the meaning behind it?
   3) What's the end goal of it all?

Words like drive, purpose and motivation are thrown around to answer those 3 questions too often because it's difficult to put into words why I get up every morning and continue to dive deeper down the same rabbit holes. For me, it's easier to focus on my final goal: happiness.

Being happy in my life is the one thing that I can strive towards. Yet I've found that incorporating that into my professional & personal life can only come with first being satisfied and content with my progress instead of my achievements.

Failure always comes first and second. Being able to be content in failure and recognizing that the reason why I fail is because of my approach instead of myself has been the biggest step towards improving the way I think and changing the method I use to tackle the problems I want to solve.

I'm not just an engineer. The reality is that no one is. Giving myself a single label restricts what I can do and why would I ever want to do that? I'm a recreational basketball player, sunset enthusiast, fruit connoisseur and so much more - but the confluence of it all is what makes me, me. It's the situations that you least expect to happen that teach you the most, and the lessons that I've taken away are what will continue to take me through the next stage of my life.

The incessant oscillating hum of the Brood X cicadas emerging from the ground after 17 years and swarming from tree to tree in my backyard is overpowering at times, but it helps me understand that the world moves on - whether or not you're ready for it. From past to present to future, the pace at which the world around you moves can leave you behind if you're not ready . The most important things for me to learn 17 years ago were my ABCs and the best way to tumble down stairs. Today, if you ask me the same question, that answer seems so much more difficult - where do I even begin? In what context? From DeFi to basketball to food to music there are so many things I want to learn about and explore and finding that optimal balance is the hardest challenge to solve. How do I be all the things that I want to be while still leaving time for me to discover for myself?

I can't. Sacrifice probably isn't the best word, but nothing else even comes close to explaining how I have to leave things I'm passionate about behind to explore things that I care more deeply about. The patchwork of decisions that have led me to where I am today is something I guarantee I wouldn't be able to repeat, and given the chance to go back 17 years and start over, I wouldn't.

I'm sure if I read this 17 years from now with the perspective and context that I have then all these thoughts will seem trivial. As to where I will be 17 years from today? Your guess is probably as good as mine.

What I can control is where I want to be, and the first step in that is recognizing who I am. No single word can encapsulate that, but there's no way I'm about to let a label I didn't create describe who I am. The best way to grow is by being me, and I'll live by that forever.
