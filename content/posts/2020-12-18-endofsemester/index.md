<span style="font-size: 15px;">Throwback to a family pic after my first NBA game! (with the throwback iggy jersey nonetheless)</span>

I'm currently writing this halfway into a 15-nour stretch in the lovely SFO airport due to a flight malfunction that delayed an 11am takeoff time to 11pm, and there's nothing in my eyes that can describe 2020 better than that. Yet, even after realizing this is the most that I've walked in the past month - 9.3 miles of aimless walking around Terminal 3 - so much time to decompress after finals is something that I'm glad to take advantage of.

Looking forward to what's on my mind for Winter Break --> Startups, DeFi, NBA Kickoff, the NFL playoffs and getting my license! 

Insanity. There is no other way to describe the flurry of tech IPO's that have taken over the past year, starting with Lemonade and culminating this past month with AirBnB, DoorDash, Wish and C3.ai. Despite the pandemic fundamentally transforming our daily lives, the valuations of startups, especially those with significant funding and public recognition are being pushed to new heights by new investors who have been welcomed with open arms by the industry. Companies that are empowering the next generation of investors are also laying the foundation for signficant risk, with issues raised across the board about the lack of education for investors about the perils of investing in the stock market, and especially IPO's, but when the market is hot concerns are often tossed aside. Watching retail investors and especially the impact of influencers in the space such as Dave Portnoy has proved to be meaningful in impacting stock performance over the past year, and with the continued gamification of stocks as a whole, the balance between what gains users and what is best for users will be one that will be a necessity for startups in the FinTech consumer space to consider over the next decade.

I've really been looking forward to diving back into the realms of DeFi ever since my internship this past summer, and with finals finally wrapping up, I'm going to be able to do so, especially as a new holder of the $1INCH airdrop. It's been amazing to see the transformation of the space over the past couple months, with the start of the bear market, and now with the advent of new regulations entering the markets, such as the FinCen ruling and the SEC XRP filing, it'll be fascinating to see how the balance between innovation and regulation is managed.

Sports during the pandemic have been completely different than the traditional era of sports. With increased monitoring of players due to COVID protocols, especially in the NBA, a new light has been shined on what goes on behind the scenes and off-the-court for many players. Without an audience within stadiums, game noises have to replace infamous "OOH's" and booing that tend to dominate rowdy playoff Game 7's. However, I can't deny that seeing the end of the Golden State Era and a transition into a duo-heavy NBA, from the Nets to the Lakers to the Wizards has been exciting, and I'm sure that the playoffs will prove to be even more so.

2020 was a year of change for me, from moving into my first apartment, completing my first college internship to living in a pandemic, but if there's anything that I've learned this year, it's that in order to do what YOU want to do, you need to believe that you can do it. With that mindset, I'm ready to see what 2021 has in store!
