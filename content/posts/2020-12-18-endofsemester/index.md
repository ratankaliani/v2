<span style="font-size: 11px;">Throwback to a family pic after my first NBA game! (with the throwback iggy jersey nonetheless)</span>

I'm currently writing this halfway into a 15-nour stretch in the lovely SFO airport due to a flight malfunction that delayed an 11am takeoff time to 11pm, and there's nothing in my eyes that can describe 2020 better than that. Yet, even after realizing this is the most that I've walked in the past month - 9.3 miles of aimless walking around Terminal 3 - so much time to decompress after finals is something that I'm glad to take advantage of. More than ever this past 4 months, I've come to the realization that everything in our life ends up turning into set of switches for our personality. For finals, I turn on a switch in my head and divert all of my energy to the part of my personality that can sit down, listen to lofi beats and crank out 70 pages of notes in between dusk and dawn, whereas when I hop in a Gig with my friends to SF for the day, that's the last thing on my mind. 

But which of those two states is more representative of who I am, or some mixture in between the true me? Are we a sum of how we as a person perceive our individual parts or simply whatever society perceives us to be the most? 

Social interaction is underanalyzed. There is no strict definition for who you are. Who you are is a situational evaluation and is constantly changing and that's what makes analyzing who you are such an interesting dilemma. Even with a fixed values set, you will never approach two social situations the same, because no two social situations are the same, and discussing social evaluations is how I get completely sidetracked when I write these posts.

Now, how does any of the last two paragraphs even tangentially relate to a virtual semester?
